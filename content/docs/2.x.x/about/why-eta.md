## Features

Eta has a number of features that set it apart from the competition:

- Faster than most templating engines
- Supports partials
- Supports custom tags (delimeters)
- Incredibly lightweight: in comparison: the full version only weighs about **2 KB gzipped**, compared to Pug's **237 KB** and Handlebars' **21.5 KB**
- Works with other languages than HTML
- Not white-space sensitive, but white-space-trimming configurable
- Syntax accessible to non-JavaScript programmers
- Supports comments and quotes containing ending delimeter (e.g. `<% /* commented out <% something %> */ %>`)
