description: Help financial analysts verify facts and detect inconsistencies across multimodal financial reports.

---

Financial analysts and auditors need to verify information across multiple document types and formats. This use case demonstrates how Synvo AI can help verify facts across PDF reports, spreadsheet data, and visual charts by cross-referencing information from different modalities.

## Business Challenge

When analyzing financial reports, professionals often need to:
- Verify numerical consistency between text and tables
- Cross-check chart data with underlying spreadsheet data
- Ensure compliance information matches across documents
- Validate calculations across different sections

Traditional manual verification is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with large volumes of financial documents.

## Solution with Synvo

Synvo's multimodal AI can:
- Extract and understand data from PDFs, spreadsheets, and charts
- Cross-reference information across different file types
- Perform logical consistency checks
- Generate verification reports with evidence

## Implementation Example

### Scenario: Verify Annual Report Claims

An auditor needs to verify that the financial metrics claimed in an annual report's executive summary match the detailed financial statements and supporting charts.

### Step 1: Upload Multiple Document Types

```python
import requests
import json

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
files = []

# Upload annual report PDF
files.append({
    "name": "annual_report_2024.pdf",
    "type": "document"
})

# Upload detailed financial statements spreadsheet
files.append({
    "name": "financial_statements.xlsx",
    "type": "document"
})

# Upload revenue chart image
files.append({
    "name": "revenue_chart.png",
    "type": "image"
})
```

### Step 2: Cross-Modal Verification Query

```python
# Upload all files
file_ids = []
for file_info in files:
    with open(file_info["name"], "rb") as f:
        response = requests.post(
            "https://api.synvo.ai/file/upload",
            files={"file": f},
            data={"path": "/financial-verification", "build_memory": "true"},
            headers={"X-API-Key": api_key}
        )
        file_ids.append(response.json()["file_id"])

# Create verification query
verification_query = """
Please verify the following financial claims across all uploaded documents:

1. Does the total revenue claimed in the executive summary match:
   - The revenue figure in the financial statements spreadsheet (cell B12)
   - The total shown in the revenue chart

2. Verify that the net profit margin calculation is consistent:
   - Check if the margin percentage is correctly calculated from net income and revenue
   - Ensure the chart visualization accurately represents this data

3. Identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies across these documents
"""

# Query with all files
payload = {
    "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": verification_query}
        ] + [{"type": "file", "file_id": fid} for fid in file_ids]
    }]
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.synvo.ai/ai/query",
    data={
        "payload": json.dumps(payload),
        "model": "synvo",
        "force_search": "true"
    },
    headers={"X-API-Key": api_key}
)

result = response.json()
print("Verification Report:")
print(result["response"]["content"][0]["text"])
```

### Expected Output

```
Verification Report:
====================

Revenue Verification: ✅ CONFIRMED
- Executive Summary: $125.8M
- Financial Statements (Cell B12): $125,800,000
- Revenue Chart: $125.8M (visualized)
All sources are consistent.

Profit Margin Check: ⚠️ DISCREPANCY FOUND
- Executive Summary states: 15.2%
- Calculated from financial statements: 14.8%
- Chart visualizes: 15.2%

Discrepancy analysis: The chart and executive summary match, but the 
calculation from the source data shows 14.8%. Recommend verifying 
the calculation method used in the summary.

Recommendations:
1. Verify the calculation methodology for the 15.2% figure
2. Check for rounding differences or excluded items
3. Document the approved calculation method for consistency
```

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Document Comparison

```python
# Verify consistency across multiple reports
comparison_query = """
Compare the Q4 revenue figures across these three documents:
- Q4-2024-Report.pdf
- Quarterly-Actuals.xlsx  
- Revenue-Dashboard-Chart.png

Identify if there are any version differences or data inconsistencies.
"""
```

### Automated Compliance Checks

```python
# Check regulatory compliance
compliance_query = """
Based on the uploaded annual report and financial disclosures:

1. Does the reporting format comply with IFRS standards?
2. Are all required financial ratios present and correctly calculated?
3. Verify that all footnotes match their referenced financial items
"""
```

## Benefits
