The Synvo API provides enterprise-grade user isolation capabilities within a single account. This powerful feature enables administrators to efficiently manage multiple clients or teams, with each entity operating in their own completely isolated environment. 

User isolation extends across all system components:

- **File Systems**: Each user has their own dedicated file storage space
- **Query Processing**: Queries and responses are contained within user boundaries
- **User Profiles**: Profile data and preferences remain strictly separated
- **History & Analytics**: Usage patterns and historical data are isolated by user

This comprehensive isolation architecture ensures complete separation of data and profiling between different clients, preventing any cross-contamination of information. Organizations can maintain the highest standards of security and privacy while serving multiple clients through a unified administrative account, simplifying management while preserving data integrity.

## Usage

User isolation is implemented through the `sub_user_name` parameter in API requests. This parameter allows administrators to specify which user's environment to access or modify. Below are examples of how to use this feature with various API endpoints:
### Creating a Directory

To create a directory in the Synvo API environment while maintaining user isolation, the `sub_user_name` parameter can be optionally specified in your request. If you do not provide a `sub_user_name`, a directory under the **/default** path will be created.

```python
import requests

# Define the API endpoint for creating a directory
url = "https://api.synvo.ai/file/create_dir"

# The body of the request, including sub_user_name for user isolation
body = {
    "sub_user_name": "example_user"
}

# HTTP headers including your API key
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    "X-API-Key": "your_api_key_here"
}

# Make the POST request
response = requests.post(url, data=body, headers=headers)

# Output the response
print(response.text)
```

#### Example Output

Here is an example of what the output might look like after executing the request:

```
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Directory created successfully for sub_user_name 'example_user'.",
  "detail": "A new directory '/client1' has been created."
}
```
