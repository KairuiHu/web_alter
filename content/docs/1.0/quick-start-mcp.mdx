A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude to upload files and query Synvo AI's powerful document analysis environment.

## What Can This MCP Server Do?

This server adds two powerful capabilities to your AI agent:

üöÄ **Upload & Analyze Files** - Upload documents, images, videos, and audio files to Synvo's contextual memory system

üîç **Query with Context** - Ask intelligent questions about your uploaded content and get precise, contextualized responses

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the MCP Server

```bash
npm install -g @synvo/mcp-server
```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "synvo": {
      "command": "synvo-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--api-key", "YOUR_SYNVO_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Get Your API Key

1. Visit [Synvo Console](https://console.synvo.ai)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key to your configuration

### 4. Start Using with Claude

Once configured, you can use these commands in Claude:

- **Upload a file**: "Upload this document to Synvo"
- **Query content**: "What does this document say about [topic]?"
- **Search across files**: "Find information about [topic] in my uploaded files"

## Example Usage

### Upload and Query a Document

```
User: Upload this PDF to Synvo and then tell me what it says about the company's revenue growth.

Claude: I'll upload the PDF to Synvo and analyze it for you.

[Uploads file to Synvo]

Based on the document, the company shows a 15% year-over-year revenue growth, primarily driven by increased subscription sales in the enterprise segment.
```

### Multi-Modal Analysis

```
User: Upload this image and video, then compare the information in both.

Claude: I'll upload both files to Synvo and provide a comparative analysis.

[Uploads both files]

The image shows the event poster with basic details, while the video provides additional context about the speaker's background and presentation topics.
```
